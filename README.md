In my 9th-grade class, I was introduced to Computer Science for the first time, where I began learning C++. I quickly developed a strong passion for it, immersing myself in PBinfo and tackling numerous problems. Over the summer between 9th and 10th grade, I embarked on a project that filled me with immense pride.

Back then, I had little knowledge of OOP concepts, code reuse, or databases. Nevertheless, I managed to implement data persistence using a text fileâ€”a feat that made me feel incredibly accomplished. I incorporated features like grade entry and cancellation, exam grade recording, absences (with the option for justification), and much more.

This project stands out to me as my inaugural venture into application development. While it was far from flawless, it marked the beginning of my journey into the IT world through this electronic catalog.

Below, you'll find a demo video showcasing the application:
